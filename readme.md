## 🚀 Features

- Cleans and preprocesses raw news text
- Vectorizes using TF-IDF
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Predicts whether input text is FAKE or REAL
- CLI-based input/output for simplicity

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- TfidfVectorizer
- Logistic Regression
